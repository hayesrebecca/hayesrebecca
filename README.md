## Hi there 👋 I'm Rebecca Hayes (she/they)  

### I'm a PhD Candidate at University of Oregon in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution.  

I study bee gut microbiomes, biogeography, network ecology, community ecology, and data science.  

I am passionate about applying data science techniques to real-world data and answering important questions that help stakeholders better understand the world around them. From environmental non-profits, to academic organizations, to public transit departments, I've worked with all kinds of stakeholders to make sense of messy data and provide insights into the topics that matter most to them.
